								<p>When it comes to Java development, two Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) stand out â€” Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. Both have been pillars of the Java ecosystem for years, offering robust tools that enhance developer productivity. While they share many core features, each has its own unique strengths, workflows, and ecosystems.

                                    In this blog, we'll dive into a detailed comparison of Eclipse vs IntelliJ IDEA, examining their key differences, advantages, drawbacks, and ideal use cases. Whether you're a beginner choosing your first IDE or a seasoned developer considering a switch in 2025, this guide will help you make an informed decision.</p>
                                    <p>**Eclipse** is an open-source IDE that has been around since 2001. It is known for its flexibility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and strong support for Java development.
